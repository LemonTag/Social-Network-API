# Description
What was my motivation?
My motivation was to learn how to use Insomnia more and get the routes all working together.

Why did you build this project?
I built this project to gain a better understanding of routes, how APIs work together, and how to use Insomnia.

What problems does it solve?
The problems I solved were how to get the route names right and how it saves data.

What did I learn?
I learned how to use Insomnia and use routes.

What makes your project stand out?
My project stands out becuase it has all the routes working and shows you make more users/friends, and you can delete them.

# Installation
I opened git labs and made a git clone of the challenges I had to complete into a separate folder, which I then made into my Social-Network folder. 
After that, I went into my git hub, created repositories for my Web-API, and connected them with my challenges folder using git bash. I also created my assets folder there.
Then, I open the folder using Visual Studio code to make my index.html and style.css, and Javascript to use my project.
